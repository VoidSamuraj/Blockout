## How to play
### Motion control:
* W / S: Rotation around the X axis.
* A / D: Rotation around the Y axis.
* Q / E: Rotation around the Z axis.
* Space: Move the block forward.

## Game
The game involves arranging blocks in such a way as to fill entire planes, which will cause them to disappear and gain points. Each block is rotatable in three dimensions, adding a new level of challenge and strategy.
